We will use MemoQ as it is more flexible (you can export to Excel, csv both the TM's and the TB's).

If you need to migrate TM's and TB's from Trados to MemoQ:

For TM's  you have use Wordfast Converter (Wfconverter)

Upload Trados .sdltm and convert to .tmx (MemoQ)
(Finally to upload to MemoQ this .tmx you have to first create an empty TM and then import the file in the empty one).

To import to Trados from MemoQ is more straightforward as Trados supports .tmx files.

For TB's 
Trados needs SDL Multiterm. As Trados cannot be easy to manage regardin termbases, it is better to work on MemoQ
then export the termbase in a format-like Trados (as .XML).
MemoQ usually exports also a file (.xdt) that indicates the structure of the termbase

On SDL Multiterm: Import and poin to the .xdt file. After completing the creation of the empty termbases
Just click on Import-> Process and then select the .XML file containing the terms.

It will ask also for an exclusion file: just click on save and give any name you want

Afterthat just click on 'Finish'

Closing SDL Multiterm and opening Trados, just select 'Use existing termbase'.
